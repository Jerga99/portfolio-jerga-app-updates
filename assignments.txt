------- CREATE NEW PAGES --------
1. Create "about", "portfolios", "blogs", "cv" page.
2. Make all of the pages function components
3. Return just simple text "I am a 'blogs' page..."


------------ GET POSTS --------------------
1. In getInitialProps of "portfolios" page create new get request
   with axios to endpoint: 'https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts'
2. Get data (first 10 posts) from response and pass them to return of getInitialProps
   so you can get them in props of the page
3. in return of portfolios page display data of posts you just fetched
   You can create <ul> with <li> posts where you will display {post.id}
4. good luck (:
